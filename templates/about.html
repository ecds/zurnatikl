  <h2>About</h2>

    <p>Schooling Donald Allen: Networking the New American Poetry uses data
    from a dozen representative and rare poetry journals to visualize and debate the schools of
    poetry in Allen’s noted anthology, The New American Poetry: 1945-1960. A partnership between
    the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship (ECDS) and the Raymond Danowski Poetry Library at
    Emory University, Schooling Donald Allen uses over 10,000 data points to answer fundamental
    questions — and question our assumptions — about the nature of poetry and culture in the second
    half of the twentieth century.</p>

    <p>The poetry library of record for the twentieth century, the Raymond Danowski
    Poetry Library includes 75,000 volumes, 50,000 issues of journals, thousands of broadsides,
    countercultural material, manuscripts, recordings, and objects. Assembled by collector
    Raymond Danowski over 30 years, the collection is thought to have been the largest library
    in private hands until its arrival at Emory in 2004.</p>

    <p>Digital Danowski is a new initiative of the Danowski Poetry Library that
    seeks to make visible portions of the collection otherwise unseen.</p>

    <p>The inaugural project of the initiative, Schooling Donald Allen began with an
    exciting set of research questions that aimed to complicate and challenge some key narratives
    and assumptions of U.S. literary history. Specifically, the project seeks to test Allen’s
    taxonomy of postwar poetic schools against the networks of publication, collaboration, and
    editorial labor captured in the Danowski Poetry Library’s wide-ranging archive of postwar
    magazines, periodicals, newsletters, and literary journals.</p>

    <p>To visualize those networks, the project undertook ambitious data
    collection, recording bibliographic and other information from twelve journals of midcentury
    American poetry—including Beatitude, The Black Mountain Review, Origin, Measure, The Floating
    Bear, Intrepid, Yugen, “C”: A Magazine of Poetry, Big Table, Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts,
    J: A Magazine of Poetry, and Evergreen Review—many available digitally for the first time.
    The resulting resource documents over 750 different authors, editors, and translators, and
    includes over 10,000 pieces of data.</p>

    <p>The project's findings provide compelling grounds for a significant
    reappraisal of scholarly understandings of the postwar period, as well as a rich data set
    that can be mined further for any number of future Digital Danowski projects. Goals for the
    projects include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Challenging received narratives of literary history</li>
        <li>Increasing awareness of &amp; access to rare and influential periodicals in collection</li>
        <li>Fostering collaborations among archivists, software engineers, digital scholars, and poetry lovers</li>
        <li>Employing graduate students to learn data collection &amp; digital scholarship methodologies</li>
        <li>Exploring new scholarly uses of journals &amp; open access to project data results</li>
        <li>Creating a model for future digital projects at Emory &amp; our peer institutions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With the first round data collection completed, we are undertaking the
    next phase of the project. This work includes creating network graphs—visual analyses of
    connections among schools, poets, journals,and geographical location—and expanding the
    scope of the data questions. Initial findings have already been presented at two conferences
    presentations in June 2015: by Lisa Chinn at the DHSI (Digital Humanities Summer Institute)
    and Brian Croxall at the CSDH/SCHN Digital Humanities Conference. We anticipate sharing
    full results for Schooling Donald Allen by summer 2016.</p>

    <p>We look ahead to further Digital Danowski projects in the near future.</p>
