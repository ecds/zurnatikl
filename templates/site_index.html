            Raymond Danowski Poetry Library at Emory University, Schooling Donald Allen uses data from a dozen
            midcentury poetry journals to visualize and debate the schools of poetry established by Allenâ€™s noted
            anthology <em>The New American Poetry: 1945-1960</em>. The results complicate and challenge some key narratives
            and assumptions of postwar literary history.</p>
