                                <p>About Schooling Donald Allen: Networking the New American Poetry uses data from a dozen representative and rare poetry journals to visualize and debate the schools of poetry in Allen’s noted anthology, The New American Poetry: 1945-1960. A partnership between the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship (ECDS) and the Raymond Danowski Poetry Library at Emory University, Schooling Donald Allen uses over 10,000 data points to answer fundamental questions — and question our assumptions — about the nature of poetry and culture in the second half of the twentieth century.</p>
                                <p>Specifically, the project seeks to test Allen’s taxonomy of postwar poetic schools against the networks of publication, collaboration, and editorial labor captured in the Danowski Poetry Library’s wide-ranging archive of postwar magazines, periodicals, newsletters, and literary journals.</p>
                                <p>To visualize those networks, the project undertook ambitious data collection, recording bibliographic and other information from twelve journals of midcentury American poetry—including Beatitude, The Black Mountain Review, Origin, Measure, The Floating Bear, Intrepid, Yugen, “C”: A Journal of Poetry, Big Table, Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts, J: A Magazine of Poetry, and Evergreen Review—many available digitally for the first time. The resulting resource documents over 750 different authors, editors, and translators, and includes over 10,000 pieces of data.</p>
                                <p>With the first round data collection completed, we are undertaking the next phase of the project. This work includes creating network graphs—visual analyses of connections among schools, poets, journals,and geographical location—and expanding the scope of the data questions. Initial findings have already been presented at two conferences presentations in June 2015: by Lisa Chinn at the DHSI (Digital Humanities Summer Institute) and Brian Croxall at the CSDH/SCHN Digital Humanities Conference. We anticipate sharing full results for Schooling Donald Allen by summer 2016.</p>

                                    <p>The poetry library of record for the twentieth century, the Raymond Danowski Poetry Library includes 75,000 volumes, 50,000 issues of journals, thousands of broadsides, countercultural material, manuscripts, recordings, and objects. Assembled by collector Raymond Danowski over 30 years, the collection is thought to have been the largest library in private hands until its arrival at Emory in 2004.</p>
                                    <p>Digital Danowski is a new initiative of the Danowski Poetry Library that seeks to make visible portions of the collection otherwise unseen. Goals for the projects include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Challenging received narratives of literary history</li>
                                        <li>Increasing awareness of & access to rare and influential periodicals in collection</li>
                                        <li>Fostering collaborations among archivists, software engineers, digital scholars, and poetry lovers</li>
                                        <li>Employing graduate students to learn data collection & digital scholarship methodologies</li>
                                        <li>Exploring new scholarly uses of journals & open access to project data results</li>
                                        <li>Creating a model for future digital projects at Emory & our peer institutions</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The inaugural project of the initiative, Schooling Donald Allen began with an exciting set of research questions that aimed to complicate and challenge some key narratives and assumptions of U.S. literary history. The project's findings provide compelling grounds for a significant reappraisal of scholarly understandings of the postwar period, as well as a rich data set that can be mined further for any number of future Digital Danowski projects.</p>
                                    <p>We look ahead to further Digital Danowski projects in the near future.</p>

                                <p>Schooling Donald Allen is a collaboration between the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship (ECDS) and the Raymond Danowski Poetry Library of the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives & Rare Book Library.</p>

<p>The project site and network graphs are built with zurnatikl, a Django web application created to investigate and analyze the networks among journal contributors such as authors, editors, and translators.</p>

<p>Schooling Donald Allen was proposed and developed by Lisa Chinn, Brian Croxall, and Rebecca Sutton Koeser.</p>
