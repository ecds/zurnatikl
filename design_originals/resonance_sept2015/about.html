		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Schooling Donald Allen: Networking the New American Poetry uses data 
		from a dozen representative and rare poetry journals to visualize and debate the schools of 
		poetry in Allen’s noted anthology, The New American Poetry: 1945-1960. A partnership between 
		the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship (ECDS) and the Raymond Danowski Poetry Library at 
		Emory University, Schooling Donald Allen uses over 10,000 data points to answer fundamental 
		questions — and question our assumptions — about the nature of poetry and culture in the second 
		half of the twentieth century.</p>

		<p>The poetry library of record for the twentieth century, the Raymond Danowski 
		Poetry Library includes 75,000 volumes, 50,000 issues of journals, thousands of broadsides, 
		countercultural material, manuscripts, recordings, and objects. Assembled by collector 
		Raymond Danowski over 30 years, the collection is thought to have been the largest library 
		in private hands until its arrival at Emory in 2004.</p>

		<p>Digital Danowski is a new initiative of the Danowski Poetry Library that 
		seeks to make visible portions of the collection otherwise unseen.</p> 

		<p>The inaugural project of the initiative, Schooling Donald Allen began with an 	
		exciting set of research questions that aimed to complicate and challenge some key narratives 
		and assumptions of U.S. literary history. Specifically, the project seeks to test Allen’s 
		taxonomy of postwar poetic schools against the networks of publication, collaboration, and 
		editorial labor captured in the Danowski Poetry Library’s wide-ranging archive of postwar 
		magazines, periodicals, newsletters, and literary journals.</p>

		<p>To visualize those networks, the project undertook ambitious data 
		collection, recording bibliographic and other information from twelve journals of midcentury 
		American poetry—including Beatitude, The Black Mountain Review, Origin, Measure, The Floating 
		Bear, Intrepid, Yugen, “C”: A Magazine of Poetry, Big Table, Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts, 
		J: A Magazine of Poetry, and Evergreen Review—many available digitally for the first time. 
		The resulting resource documents over 750 different authors, editors, and translators, and 
		includes over 10,000 pieces of data.</p>

		<p>The project's findings provide compelling grounds for a significant 
		reappraisal of scholarly understandings of the postwar period, as well as a rich data set 
		that can be mined further for any number of future Digital Danowski projects. Goals for the 
		projects include:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Challenging received narratives of literary history</li>
			<li>Increasing awareness of & access to rare and influential periodicals in collection</li>
			<li>Fostering collaborations among archivists, software engineers, digital scholars, and poetry lovers</li>
			<li>Employing graduate students to learn data collection & digital scholarship methodologies</li>
			<li>Exploring new scholarly uses of journals & open access to project data results</li>
			<li>Creating a model for future digital projects at Emory & our peer institutions</li>
		</ul>

		<p>With the first round data collection completed, we are undertaking the 
		next phase of the project. This work includes creating network graphs—visual analyses of 
		connections among schools, poets, journals,and geographical location—and expanding the 
		scope of the data questions. Initial findings have already been presented at two conferences 
		presentations in June 2015: by Lisa Chinn at the DHSI (Digital Humanities Summer Institute) 
		and Brian Croxall at the CSDH/SCHN Digital Humanities Conference. We anticipate sharing 
		full results for Schooling Donald Allen by summer 2016.</p>

		<p>We look ahead to further Digital Danowski projects in the near future.</p>
