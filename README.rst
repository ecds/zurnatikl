-------------

**zurnatikl** is a Django_ web application created to investigate
and analyze the networks among journal contributors such as authors, editors, and translators.
In particular, it was created to investigate the "little magazines" and mimeozines included in the
`The Raymond Danowski Poetry Library`_. Read the `project description`_
on the `Danowski Poetry Library site`_.

Currently, this application consists of a Django admin site for data entry
of journals, issues, items with associated people and locations, and
a network graph export of that data for analysis with external tools, and preliminary
presentation of bibliographic data and networks for journal contributors.

The project code name **zurnatikl** is derived from the Latvian words for magazine or journal is (*žurnāls*) and network (*tīkls**).
