**digital_danowski** is a Django_ web application created to investigate
and analyze the networks among authors connected to some of the
"little magazines" and mimeozines included in the
 `The Raymond Danowski Poetry Library`_.
Read the `project description`_ on the `Danowski Poetry Library site`_.


Currently, this application consists of a Django admin site for data entry
of journals, issues, items with associated people and locations, and
a network graph export of that data for analysis with external tools.
